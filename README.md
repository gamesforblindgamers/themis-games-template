# Themis Games Blind-Accessible HTML + Javascript Game Template

Blind-accessible HTML/Javascript game template, developed and maintained by Themis Games. You can read more about how it works, and the different considerations for web accessible games, [in this excellent write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_YLephE5T3NGcvpWablU7TwMfeC04Of71-ohsAUjww).

Note that the repo owner (Night Blade) is not affiliated with Themis Games in any way, and is simply providing an up-to-date git repo of their code (as much as possible).
